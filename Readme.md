![Extension Icon](icon.png)

StopRedditRedesign is a Chrome extension that allows you to switch between the R3 rediesgn which can be found as `sh.reddit.com` and original Reddit `new.reddit.com` versions effortlessly. It provides a convenient toggle to switch to the new.reddit.com subdomain and back to the new Reddit interface.

The developer has also created a subreddit called r/notoredditredesign, where you can discuss the extension and provide feedback but also show Reddit how much we hate there idea for a new Reddit design.

## Reverting to Previous Reddit

To revert back to your previous Reddit version, simply retype the URL `reddit.com` in the address bar of your browser.

## Disclaimer

This project is still under development, and we will regularly release updates. Please check back periodically, especially after new versions are released. Contributions to the project are very much welcome.

None of the icon images used are mine, I grabbed them from the internet!

Enjoy using this absolute dogshit of an extension that I made in less than a day and probably has a bunch of bugs that I will have to fix and have a great Reddit browsing experience!

## Note:

To anyone contributing, idk if this matters but I accidentally set the main branch as main-actual so when you commit the main branch is now called main-actual just an FYI

so it becomes "git push -u origin main-actual"

if you know how to fix that well tell me cause im dumb :D

## Todo:
1. Well the checkbox doent actually do anything in the options section, its just if u click the extension so fix that i guess
